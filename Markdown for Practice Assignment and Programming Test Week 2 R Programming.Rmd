## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:





# https://github.com/rdpeng/practice_assignment/blob/master/practice_assignment.rmd 

#The first 2 lines of this command didn't work, so I am manually downloading and trying from there

dataset_url <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/practice_assignment/diet_data.zip"
download.file(dataset_url, "diet_data.zip")

#The command below should still work

```r {, echo = TRUE}
unzip("diet_data.zip", exdir = "diet_data")
```


#shows the diet_data folder

list.files()

# shows the five .csv files

list.files("diet_data")

# sets andy as a file we're reading... notice that we're still in a working directory a parent above where we're looking

```{r}
andy <- read.csv("diet_data/Andy.csv")
```

#gives us the header names

```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(andy)
```

# see how many rows are in one of the columns
# Both the commands below work, one is looking at the dataset, which is andy. The first
# specifies that it's the column with the header Weight. The 2nd specifies that it's
# the column with a blank for the row cuz we're not looking at rows, then the 3rd column

```{r}
length(andy$Weight)
length(andy[ , 3])
```


Some other ways to get yourself some useful data

dim(andy)

#gets you some other helpful info

```{r}
str(andy)
summary(andy)
names(andy)
```

Let's take the output of `list.files()` and store it:
```{r}
files <- list.files("diet_data")
files
```



Let's take a quick look at John.csv:
```{r error=TRUE}
head(read.csv(files[3]))
```



Woah, what happened?  Well, John.csv is sitting inside the diet_data folder.  We just tried to run the equivalent of `read.csv("John.csv")` and R correctly told us that there isn't a file called John.csv in our working directory.  To fix this, we need to append the directory to the beginning of the file name.

One approach would be to use `paste()` or `sprintf()`.  However, if you go back to the help file for `list.files()`, you'll see that there is an argument called `full.names` that will append (technically prepend) the path to the file name for us.


files_full <- list.files("diet_data", full.names=TRUE)
files_full

Now we can read the individual files from here
head(read.csv(files_full[3]))


Success!  So what if we wanted to create one big data frame with everybody's data in it?  We'd do that with rbind and a loop.  Let's start with rbind:

THIS ASSUMES YOU HAVE ALREADY ADDED the file andy

```{r}
andy_david <- rbind(andy, read.csv(files_full[2]))
```

Success!  So what if we wanted to create one big data frame with everybody's data in it?  We'd do that with rbind and a loop.  Let's start with rbind:

```{r}
andy_david <- rbind(andy, read.csv(files_full[2]))
```

This works if you don't already have a dataframe for andy

david_john <- rbind(read.csv(files_full[2]), read.csv(files_full[3]))

Trying on my own to create a sum total here YIKES

total <- function()


How do I get these 2 to go together

Need an empty data frame
dat <- data.frame()


for (i in 1:5) {
dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(files_full[i])) 
}  

for (i in 1:5) {
        dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(files_full[i]))
}

dat <- data.frame()
for (i in 1:5) {
        dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(files_full[i]))
}

total <- function(y){
for (i in seq_along(y)) {
        dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(y[i]))
}
dat
}

Cool.  We now have a data frame called 'dat' with all of our data in it.  Out of curiousity, what would happen if we had put `dat <- data.frame()` inside of the loop?  Let's see:

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
        dat2 <- data.frame()
        dat2 <- rbind(dat2, read.csv(files_full[i]))
}
str(dat2)
head(dat2)
```

Because we put `dat2 <- data.frame()` inside of the loop, `dat2` is being rewritten with each pass of the loop.  So we only end up with the data from the last file in our list.


median(dat)




total_median_weight_day <- function(y,z){
     for (i in seq_along(y)) {
         dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(y[i]))
     }
     hmm <- dat[which(dat[, "Day"] == z),]
     dis <- median(hmm$Weight, na.rm = TRUE)
     dis
 }




total_data_day <- function(y,z){
     for (i in seq_along(y)) {
         dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(y[i]))
     }
     hmm <- dat[which(dat[, "Day"] == z),]
     hmm
 }


Gets you the info for a specific day

dat_30 <- dat[which(dat[, "Day"] == 30),]












get_directory <- list.files("specdata", full.names=TRUE)


combine <- for (i in 1:332)) {
dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(get_directory[i]))
}


sub <- data.frame()

full_data_set <- for (i in seq_along(get_directory)) {
        sub <- rbind(sub, read.csv(get_directory[i]))
}



sub_23 <- sub[which(sub[, "ID"] == 23),]


pollutant <- function(directory) {
for (i in seq_along(directory)) {
hup <- rbind(hup, read.csv(directory[i]))
}


pollutant <- function(directory, pollutant, id) {
for (i in seq_along(directory)) {
hup <- rbind(hup, read.csv(directory[i]))
}
hmm <- hup[which(hup[, "ID"] %in% id),]
dis <- mean(hmm[,"pollutant"], na.RM = TRUE)
dis
}








Last try for the actual homework - I am trying to add an argument that lets me pick everything in a column.
And I am trying to change things to fit my parameters


total_mean_nitrate_id <- function(y,z){
     for (i in seq_along(y)) {
         dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(y[i]))
     }
     hmm <- dat[which(dat[, "ID"] == z),]
     dis <- mean(hmm$nitrate, na.rm = TRUE)
     dis
 }


This is so goddamn close to the answer for 1

 total_mean_pollutant_id <- function(directory,pollutant,id){
     for (i in seq_along(directory)) {
         dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(directory[i]))
     }
     hmm <- dat[which(dat[, "ID"] %in% id),]
     dis <- mean(hmm[,pollutant], na.rm = TRUE)
     dis
 }


This is so goddamn close to the answer for 2

 total_obs <- function(directory,id){
     for (i in seq_along(directory)) {
         dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(directory[i]))
     }
     hmm <- dat[which(dat[, "ID"] %in% id),]
     dis <- sum(complete.cases(hmm$nitrate,hmm$sulfate))
     dis
 }
